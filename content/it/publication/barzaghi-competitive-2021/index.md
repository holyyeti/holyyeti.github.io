abstract: "This work aims to define a series of reference models that would serve\
  \ as a guide to the design and development of the National Edition of Aldo Moro's\
  \ works. These models have been defined through a benchmarking process that is organized\
  \ as follows: content analysis on a sample of 30 digital editions, evaluated on\
  \ the basis of certain criteria defined in [Sahle 2014]; processing of the data\
  \ gathered as a result of the content analysis, so as to extract the relevant information,\
  \ and visualize it; review of the data processing results and consideration of the\
  \ models that can be used as reference. The digital editions that meet the quality\
  \ criteria taken into consideration are equipped with the following characteristics:\
  \ their audience is composed of both domain experts and generic users; their documentation\
  \ is rich and accurate; their content is described by a complete set of metadata;\
  \ they and their single parts are citable and uniquely identifiable; their data\
  \ model is geared towards interoperability and interlinking between its contents\
  \ and the relevant resources already existing on the Web; they use visualization\
  \ and storytelling tools so as to convey information intuitively; their information\
  \ architecture is well-structured and easily navigated; their data and contents\
  \ can be downloaded in many different formats; they take advantage of Open Source\
  \ software and tools; finally, their contents are open and accessible to anyone."
