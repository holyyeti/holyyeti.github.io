abstract: 'The dataset collects a series of values associated with a sample of 30
  digital editions, and based on some evaluation criteria for reviewing scholarly
  digital editions compiled by Patrick Sahle in collaboration with Georg Voegler and
  IDE (Institut für Dokumentologie und Editorik) members (Sahle 2014). In particular,
  the aspects that have been taken into consideration during the evaluation process
  are the following: Documentation (Documentation, Scholarly objectives, Mission focusing
  on the objectives, Documentation and associated texts); Audience (Mission, focusing
  on the audience); Representation (Representation of documents and texts); Data model (Data
  modelling); Browse; Search; Indices; Quality of the presentation; Metadata (Metadata
  for description of and interlinkage between objects in the edition); Identification (Identification
  and citation); Formats (Spin offs and export formats); OS-OA (Access to basic data, Rights
  and licences); Additional features; Each aspect (except for Audience and Data model)
  has been given a score between 0, 0.5, and 1, where: 0 represents a value that witnesses
  either the total absence or the lack of quality of the edition in terms of that
  specific aspect; 0.5 represents a value that witnesses a suboptimal implementation
  of that specific aspect in the edition; 1 represents a value that witnesses an optimal
  implementation of that specific aspect in the edition.'
