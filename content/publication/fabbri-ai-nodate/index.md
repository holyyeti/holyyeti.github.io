abstract: "In the museum sector, interest in visitor engagement methods has been growing\
  \ for several years. Among these, AI and machine learning have proven to be valid\
  \ engagement and storytelling tools for museums, in particular for the creation\
  \ of interactive chatbots and better customize visitor experience. This paper aims\
  \ to reason about the possibilities of these existing tools, discussing their potential\
  \ and limitations. The collection of visitor flow data within the museum and the\
  \ interactive use of chatbots allow different levels of personalization of the visit.\
  \ The real question is: how can an evolving AI tool be transformed into a storytelling\
  \ tool that is in harmony with the museum's itinerary and allows for personalization\
  \ but also respects the museum's own identity and peculiarities? These reflections\
  \ are part of a research proposal for developing a chatbot to orient visitors within\
  \ the museum, signaling works of potential interest. The application context is\
  \ the National Museum of Ravenna, characterised by a vast and heterogeneous collection\
  \ that is difficult to use."
