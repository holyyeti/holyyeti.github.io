## Everything, Everywhere
Information technology is structural, especially in scientific research, and is used for gathering, presenting, analyzing and  drawing conclusions from data

## This is also valid for the Humanities
Availability of digital and digitized resources and tools

They facilitate existing methods

They also pave the way for new research strategies

## Enter Digital Humanities
A rapidly growing field exploring the potential of digital methods and techniques in humanities research projects

Coined in the early 2000s, the term describes a multitude of academic realities working at the interface between technology and the humanities

Still difficult to define

## One definition (among many others)
Kathleen Fitzpatrick offers an insightful definition:

> [...] a nexus of fields within which scholars use computing technologies to investigate the kinds of questions that are traditional to the humanities, or [...] ask traditional kinds of humanities-oriented questions about computing technologies.

## Still...
There has always been a divergence in nature (and thus in approaches):
- _digital_: hardware, software, algorithms, and quantifiable processes = everything is data
- _humanities_: interpretive, speculative, and comparative approaches = nothing (we do) is data

## So what do Humanities bring to computation?
Research richness derived from exposing structural assumptions through:
- diversity
- complexity
- materiality
- situated perspectives
- interpretation and speculation
- narrative forms
