## The Wave
In today’s tech-driven world, scientific research has seen a significant shift in the last decades. Researchers, once tied to traditional methods, now wade through vast amounts of data, seeking actionable insights to be drawn from it. From literature searches to collaborative efforts with peers and dissemination of research findings, scientists now have to rely on a range of digital tools and data-oriented methodologies for gathering, presenting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data.

This tidal wave hasn't spared the humanities either. The availability of digital and digitized resources has catalyzed a shift, opening new avenues for research. Articles, comments, websites, data sets, and digital expressions of art and culture have become not just resources but catalysts for transformative discourse in the humanities. 

As this intellectual force sweeps across the humanities, it challenges researchers to embrace interdisciplinary approaches, encourages the exploration of non-traditional sources, and demands a reevaluation of established methodologies. In particular, it opens up to exciting opportunities offered by comparative methods, large-scale data analysis, and machine-readable knowledge representation disseminated on the Web.

## Enter Digital Humanities
At the intersection of technology and humanities emerges a dynamic field - Digital Humanities. Coined in the early 2000s, the term encompasses various concepts and has been the center of many debates. But what exactly is it? Well, that's the thing – people can't seem to agree on a single definition. This field is a bit like a rebel, constantly challenging expectations and bringing together all sorts of conflicting academic traditions. Actually, rather than a field, it's more a dynamic mix of methods, a blend of old-school and cutting-edge.

The debate about what Digital Humanities truly is mirrors its fluid nature. Is it a community, a research endeavor, or a set of methodologies? Well, that depends on who you ask. "Digital Humanities" isn't a fixed label; it's more like a “floating signifier,” an open invitation to constantly question and redefine itself.

However, we might still attempt a definition, albeit a partial one. Kathleen Fitzpatrick offers an insightful perspective:

> a nexus of fields within which scholars use computing technologies to investigate the kinds of questions that are traditional to the humanities, or [...] ask traditional kinds of humanities-oriented questions about computing technologies.

This definition is valuable because it recognizes the interplay between “digital” and “humanities” and what it entails, highlighting the divergence (note: not an opposition) in approaches. On the one hand, Digital is about hardware, software, and algorithms, doing all that data crunching. On the other hand,  traditional humanities research brings in its interpretive, speculative, and comparative flair. The digital tends to simplify things, and ultimately focuses on implementation. Humanism takes a moment, maybe even a step back, and looks at those things in a way that complexifies them instead. 

## Actionable Literacy
Humanities inject a unique richness into computational endeavors by incorporating critical inquiries about diversity, complexity, materiality, context, and situated perspectives in the research discourse, exposing structural assumptions of our reality. However, the humanities' contribution should extend beyond thought and delve into action, addressing the needs of diverse audiences and effecting meaningful change in academic and public communities. Here is where computation shines: it's the tool that can turn these critical insights into tangible impact. By applying digital methods, we don't just analyze the world; we actively engage with it. We can design technical solutions for research questions informed by a nuanced understanding of cultural, historical, and societal contexts. 

Therefore,  the defining goal (and struggle) of Digital Humanities might be providing literacy for the contemporary world. By “literacy”, I like to refer to the definition provided by UNESCO:

> a continuum of learning and proficiency in reading, writing and using numbers throughout life and is part of a larger set of skills, which include digital skills, media literacy, education for sustainable development and global citizenship as well as job-specific skills

In the case of humanities research, the objective is to integrate it into a broader scholarly conversation with the other increasingly relevant themes defining our times, such as data, reproducibility, accessibility, artificial intelligence, and so on.
