## Digital is Everything, Everywhere

...

In today's interconnected world, information technology has seamlessly integrated into every facet of our existence. This integration is particularly pronounced in the realm of scientific research, where digital methods and techniques are pivotal in systematically generating knowledge and actionable insights. From literature searches to collaboration with peers and the dissemination of research findings, scientists now rely on an array of digital tools for gathering, presenting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data.

Of course, fields typically adverse to technological inferences were involved in this surge of leveraging digital tools for research as well. The availability of digital and digitized resources, including articles, comments, websites, data sets, and digital expressions of art and culture, is the driving force behind this transformative discourse in the humanities. More interestingly, information technology not only facilitates existing methods, but also paves the way for new research strategies, particularly in comparative methods, large-scale and long-term data analysis, and machine-readable knowledge representation disseminated on the Web.

Enter Digital Humanities.

## One possible definition
Defining the precise meaning of _Digital Humanities_ remains a matter of contention. In general, it is safe to say it is a rapidly growing field exploring the potential of digital methods and techniques in humanities research projects. Coined in the early 2000s, the term actually describes a multitude of academic realities working at the interface between technology and the humanities.

...

Kathleen Fitzpatrick offers an insightful definition:

> a nexus of fields within which scholars use computing technologies to investigate the kinds of questions that are traditional to the humanities, or [...] ask traditional kinds of humanities-oriented questions about computing technologies.

This definition is good because it recognizes that delicate interplay between the terms "digital" and "humanities" highlighting the divergence in approaches: _digital_ encompasses hardware, software, algorithms, and quantifiable processes, while traditional _humanities_ research values interpretive, speculative, and comparative approaches.

## So what do Humanities bring to computation?

Humanities bring richness to computational endeavors by incorporating diversity, complexity, materiality, context, and situated perspectives. These approaches are inherently interpretive and speculative, fostering critical inquiry that exposes structural assumptions, subjectivity, ambiguity, and contestation. Humanities play a vital role in articulating the significance of scientific discoveries, providing historical perspectives, interpretive skills, critical analyses, and narrative forms that lead to paradigm shifts.

The humanities' contribution should extend beyond thought and delve into action, addressing the needs of diverse audiences and effecting meaningful change in academic and public communities. This means providing literacy for the contemporary world: imparting the knowledge and skills required for the practical implementation of this call to action, with the aim of approaching the humanities through novel interpretative approaches and generating analytical results for a broader valorization, dissemination and use of its outputs.
