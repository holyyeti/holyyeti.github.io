Among these, AI and machine learning have proven to be valid engagement and storytelling tools for museums, in particular for the creation of interactive chatbots and better customize visitor experience. This paper aims to reason about the possibilities of these existing tools, discussing their potential and limitations. The collection of visitor flow data within the museum and the interactive use of chatbots allow different levels of personalization of the visit. The real question is: how can an evolving AI tool be transformed into a storytelling tool that is in harmony with the museum's itinerary and allows for personalization but also respects the museum's own identity and peculiarities? These reflections are part of a research proposal for developing a chatbot to orient visitors within the museum, signaling works of potential interest. The application context is the National Museum of Ravenna, characterised by a vast and heterogeneous collection that is difficult to use.","tags":[],"title":"AI and chatbots as a storytelling tool to personalize the visitor experience.

We started with a preliminary assessment of the exhibition, focussing on possible acquisition constraints - time, space, and materials - and related solutions. Then, we proceeded with the creation of the digital twin by acquiring, processing, modelling, optimising, exporting, metadating, and uploading the exhibition. We adopted a hybrid use of two distinct acquisition techniques, i.e. structured light projection scanning and photogrammetry, to create new digital cultural heritage objects and environments, and we used open technologies, formats and protocols to make available the final digital product. We described the process to collect and curate bibliographical (meta)data of the exhibition and digital twin creation process to foster its findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability.","tags":["Computer Science - Digital Libraries","Computer Science - Graphics"],"title":"Saving temporary exhibitions in virtual environments: the Digital Renaissance of Ulisse Aldrovandi","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Barzaghi","Federica Collina","Francesca Fabbri","Federica Giacomini","Alice Bordignon","Roberto Balzani","Gabriele Bitelli","Federica Bonifazi","Luca Cipriani","Simona Colitti","Marilena Daquino","Bruno Fanini","Filippo Fantini","Daniele Ferdani","Giulia Fiorini","Elena Formia","Anna Forte","Valentina Alena Girelli","Bianca Gualandi","Ivan Heibi","Alessandro Iannucci","Rachele Manganelli Del F√†","Arcangelo Massari","Arianna Moretti","Silvio Peroni","Sofia Pescarin","Giulia Renda","Diego Ronchi","Mattia Sullini","Maria Alessandra Tini","Francesca Tomasi","Laura Travaglini","Luca Vittuari"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703079207,"objectID":"0ec21d28f98555b2622c5a25887c52e6","permalink":"https://sebastianbarzaghi.github.io/publication/barzaghi-digitisation-2023/","publishdate":"2023-12-20T13:33:26.599899Z","relpermalink":"/publication/barzaghi-digitisation-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Temporary exhibitions in the cultural heritage system have become diffused. They are tools to enhance cultural heritage and to gather, in the same context, cultural goods that otherwise would never be exposed together. Their temporal limitation gives them the uniqueness of an event that will not be repeated. The exhibition \\\"The Other Renaissance: Ulisse Aldrovandi and the Wonders of the World‚Äù was created to offer visitors a tour of an exceptional legacy of objects, some of which have never been exhibited before, combined with objects, works of art from several Italian museums, and digital installations that together tell the story of how the first generation of naturalists took their first steps into science as we know it today. To store this exhibition a photogrammetric and structured light scanner survey campaign was launched to acquire 3D objects. By leveraging a combination of 3D, LOD, and Semantic Web technologies, we propose to create a digital twin (intended as an aggregation of different information about real-world heritage objects) of Aldrovandi exhibitions, to create a new digital tool differentiated from the physical exhibition, but that could store all the information and objects exposed together physically.","tags":["based design","CCS Concepts: Human-centered computing‚ÜíUser interface design","Scenario-based design","HCI theory","concepts and models","centered computing‚ÜíUser interface design","concepts and models","HCI theory","Human","Scenario"],"title":"Digitisation of Temporary Exhibitions: the Aldrovandi Case","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Barzaghi"],"categories":["Linked Open Data"],"content":"Introduction to Linked (Open) Data Sebastian Barzaghi\nsebastian.barzaghi2@unibo.it\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-0799-1527\nLinked Data: definition A way of publishing structured data so that they can be interlinked, and be processed by machines, so as to make it possible to formulate semantic queries that will yield richer information Linked Open Data: linked data that is freely and publicly available (open content) New opportunities for publishing and re-using digital research output Linked Data: main concepts Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): character strings that are used to identify a web resource Resource Description Framework (RDF): a graph model for data representation and interchange on the Web, based on the triple structure Ontology: a data structure that formally describes a finite set of concepts and the relationships between them SPARQL: a semantic query language for graph databases Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Questions?

It is centered on a set of concepts (codex, manuscript, folio, text and gloss), which have been precisely defined via the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) standard in order to model such complexity in an accurate and logically consistent structure. The model thus becomes able to cover multiple use cases and scenarios in proportion to how many requirements have been adequately met.\nWhile developing MeMO, a high priority has been given to the goal of reaching a sound balance between precision (to satisfy the user‚Äôs needs) and coverage (to ensure a certain degree of extensibility and reuse) of the model. Ultimately, the idea behind the development of MeMO has been to provide a data model for representing the aforementioned collection of medieval codices and manuscripts according to certain requirements and with the possibility to extend it for representing similar resources that exist in other collections.\nFRBR allows a holistic perspective about the resource, on multiple levels of conceptualization, by breaking down the semantic and conceptual ambiguities related to objects created by human hands into different but related and layered concepts and by allowing the description of an artifact and its relations with other entities to be more expressive, precise and dynamic. Nonetheless, FRBR has some limitations. Even though the definitions of its concepts are quite straightforward, FRBR is not easily understood by the common user, who finds the terms work, expression, manifestation and item not very clear.\nAccording to FRBR, any object (such as a manuscript, for example) has to be described by taking into consideration all the four levels in order to have a complete overview of it. This multi-leveled conceptualization is difficult for an average user to comprehend, because it is much more intuitive to expect the concept of that object to exist at a single FRBR level. In order to avoid this issue without giving up the expressivity of FRBR, a good solution is to place that object at the level that is deemed more appropriate in relation to the scenario taken into consideration.\nThis approach has been used systematically for the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology (FaBiO) (Peroni and Shotton 2012), with which MeMO has been aligned. Being an ontology focused on entities that are published, textual in nature, and/or referred to by bibliographic references, FaBiO defines its own set of entities that are subclasses of the original FRBR entities by taking advantage of the FRBRcore RDF vocabulary (FRBRcore, http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#). In order to embrace this approach and be consistent with the scenarios that are present in the case study, MeMO reuses FaBiO interpretations of FRBR entities as superclasses of its entities. In particular: manuscript, text and gloss are conceptualized as subclasses of fabio:Expression (since they are carry a content and are not inherently related to a precise format), while codex and folio are conceptualized as subclasses of fabio:Manifestation, since they carry a format that functions as a container for both text and glosses, and thus for manuscripts as well.\n","date":1584662400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584662400,"objectID":"96a903923dc715add541dda3e30ff43e","permalink":"https://sebastianbarzaghi.github.io/project/memo/","publishdate":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/memo/","section":"project","summary":"The Medieval Manuscripts Ontology (MeMO) is an OWL 2 DL ontology that aims to provide a framework for the formal description of the collection of medieval codices and manuscripts, managed by Progetto IRNERIO, according to certain requirements and with the possibility to extend it for representing similar resources that exist in other collections.","tags":["Ontology Engineering"],"title":"Medieval Manuscript Ontology (MeMO)","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sebastian Barzaghi","Monica Palmirani","Silvio Peroni"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703079191,"objectID":"5aef5669d80066c74ac9a89dddcd8979","permalink":"https://sebastianbarzaghi.github.io/publication/barzaghi-development-2020/","publishdate":"2023-12-20T13:33:10.591149Z","relpermalink":"/publication/barzaghi-development-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Development of an ontology for modelling medieval manuscripts: the case of Progetto IRNERIO","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesca Tomasi","Marilena Daquino","Sebastian Barzaghi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703079190,"objectID":"398bffa59797eae4590fe02ccf3b1584","permalink":"https://sebastianbarzaghi.github.io/publication/tomasi-vespasiano-2020/","publishdate":"2023-12-20T13:33:09.726456Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tomasi-vespasiano-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Edizione digitale semantica delle Lettere di Vespasiano da Bisticci, comprensiva di: dataset, applicazione, documentazione","tags":["M-STO/08 Archivistica","bibliografia e biblioteconomia","PE6_10 Web and information systems","database systems","information retrieval and digital libraries","data fusion","SH5_11 Cultural heritage","cultural memory"],"title":"Vespasiano da Bisticci, Lettere.
